# Hackowasp (Hackathon)
My Project in Hackowasp (incomplete)
-------------------------------
Our idea was to bring Societies and Clubs under one roof to connect them to students of a college.
We have Society Page and Student Page

Societies can Submit Posts with details regarding Events/Gathering once in a week.(So as to make them more creative about what they post).
Societies can categories themself as technical or non-technical and more domains.

Students on the other hand can Upvote or downvote a post (Which provides insights to societies about their events)
Students would only see the posts in their feeds which they have categorized (technical or non-technical and other sub-domains)

Keeping in view  Security and Privacy, all the passwords are Hashed and Certiain Procedures are followed to curb SQL-Injection.
